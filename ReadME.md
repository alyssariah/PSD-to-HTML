# Converting PSD files to HTML

How do you get from a Photoshop Document(.psd) to a completed HTML file? It is common for many web designers to create their designs in Photoshop first and then convert it to HTML later. This helps becasue as a designer they have more freedom on photoshop to foster their creativity and then it is easier to code with a clear graphical reperesentaion. Photoshop can also create images with special effects, whcih can later be transported into the HTML. HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is best practice to use the most recent version of HTML, which is HTML5. There are automated tools available to convert a PSD to HTML or for one to self-code the design into HTML.

## Setting up

It is important to slice the psd file to export layers as needed to make your HTML file. Create your main folder to hold all your files include your css folder to hold all your css files and an images folder to hold all your images. For the css files, it is a good idea to use a reset css file such as Eric Meyer's Rest CSS: https://cssreset.com/scripts/eric-meyer-reset-css/. This is important to reset all HTML elements to a consistent baseline since most browsers have their own default css settings.
