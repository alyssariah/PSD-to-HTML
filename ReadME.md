# Converting PSD files to HTML

How do you get from a Photoshop Document(.psd) to a completed HTML file? It is common for many web designers to create their designs in Photoshop first and then convert it to HTML later. As a designer, they have more freedom on Photoshop to create. It is also helpful for developers to have graphical reperesentaion and a direction while coding. Photoshop can also create images with special effects, whcih can later be transported into the HTML. HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it is best practice to use the most recent version of HTML, which is HTML5. There are two options to create a PSD file into a website. The first is using automated tools for conversion. The second is deciding to hand-code it. This repository is about the second option through hand coding.

## Setting up

It is important to slice the psd file to export layers as needed to make your HTML file. Create your main folder to hold all your files including your css folder and your images folder. For the css files, it is a good idea to use a reset css file such as Eric Meyer's Rest CSS: https://cssreset.com/scripts/eric-meyer-reset-css/. This is important to reset all HTML elements to a consistent baseline since most browsers have their own default css settings. 

## Best practices of PSD to HTML conversion
