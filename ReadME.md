# Converting PSD files to HTML

How do you get from a Photoshop Document(.psd) to a completed HTML file? It is common for many web designers to create their designs in Photoshop and then convert it to HTML later. In Photoshop, web designers have more freedom to design and can create images with special effects, which can later be transported into the HTML. It is also helpful for developers to have a graphical reperesentaion and direction while coding. HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it is best practice to use the most recent version of HTML, which is HTML5. HTML is the structure of the content seen on a web page and is styled by cascading style sheets(CSS). Websites are made with HTML and CSS, and there are two options to convert a PSD file into HTML and CSS. The first is using automated tools for conversion, and the second is to hand code it. This repository is about the second option through hand coding.

## Setting up

It is important to slice the psd file to export layers as needed to make your HTML file. Create your main folder to hold all your files including your css folder and images folder. For the css files, it is a good idea to use a reset css file such as Eric Meyer's Rest CSS: https://cssreset.com/scripts/eric-meyer-reset-css/. This is important to reset all HTML elements to a consistent baseline since most browsers have their own default css settings.
